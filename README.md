# HayesPlugins

A free, open-source collection of 8 audio plug-ins covering most common use-cases for music and film sound production. Included are a frequency equalizer, a dynamic compressor, a distortion module, a pitch shifter, a simple feedback delay, a tape delay with flutter and wobble, a feedback delay network reverb, and a convolution reverb. Each plug-in is configured to build in VST3 and AU formats and can be used in many popular Digital Audio Workstations such as Ableton, Logic, Cubase, Studio One, and Reaper.

### HayesCompressor
A free, open-source Compressor audio plug-in.
It provides both input and output gain, a meter to visualize gain reduction, as well as attack, release, threshold, ratio, and knee controls that are very useful in shaping the response of the compressor.

### HayesDelay
A free, open-source feedback delay audio plug-in. 
It creates a circular delay buffer that is written to by the main buffer and then read back from at some time parameter in the past.
With it, users can create longlasting echo chains with feedback, short slapback effects, and panned echos.

### HayesEQ
A free, open-source parametric EQ plugin that features a variable number of EQ bands (1-8) and a fully continuously-resizable GUI.
The number of filters present at any given time can be changed, and each filter can operate as a peak filter, a band-pass, a low-pass or a high-pass.

### HayesFDNReverb
A free, open-source feedback-delay network reverb with 9 all-pass diffusers, 8 delay lines, and some light filtering.
This is a commonly-used technique to create perfect-sounding reverbs, although they can sometimes be tricky to get to sound realistic.

### HayesDistortion
A free, open-source audio plugin that can apply various operations to distort the incoming signal.
Users can select specific bands of frequencies to distort at varying amounts, as well as control the overall
character of the result with a global EQ built-in.

### HayesPitchShifter
A free, open-source pitch shifter audio plug-in that provides up to one octave up or down, and uses a phase vocoder to achieve the shift. 
It can be run in interval mode, which snaps to equal temperament intervals, or simply tune the signal by some percentage between 50% and 200%.

### HayesReverb
A free, open-source convolution reverb audio plug-in.
It allows users to control the size, damp-ness, width, and mix of the reverb in their signal, plus a freeze button that perpetuates the 
reverb tail into an infinite loop.

### HayesTapeDelay
A free, open-source feedback delay plug-in with wow and flutter as well as filters added to emulate the characteristics of an analog tape delay.
